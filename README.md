Hi! Welcome to Workout Logger's Read Me file... 

I created this app to provide an example of fitness related social media site where you can log/post your workouts. All users workouts are shared on a feed located on the homepage.

To use this app, just clone, run rake db:migrate and then run shotgun. Everything should be set up. If you'd like, you can add some data from the seed file provided by running rake db:seed as well.
