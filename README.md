Hi! Welcome to Workout Logger's Read Me file... 

I created this app to provide an example of fitness related social media site where you can log/post your workouts. All users workouts are shared on a feed located on the homepage. By creating a user account you can access all the app has to offer, including access everyones posted workouts, ability to post your own workouts and to post your own exercises to add to those workouts. You also have access to your profile page which you can post a bio for yourself on. 

To use this app, just clone, run rake db:migrate and then run shotgun. Everything should be set up. If you'd like, you can add some data from the seed file provided by running rake db:seed as well.
